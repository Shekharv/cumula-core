# Welcome to Cumula

## Web development for the cloud. Made easy.

Cumula is an open-source framework that creates scalable cloud-based applications.  Itâ€™s makes using cloud services simple, elegant and lightweight.  In other words, code less to create applications that do more. 

At its core, Cumula is a lightweight framework of pre-built components.  These components simplify the process of working with web services, meaning that it takes less code to write complicated applications.  Because of its modular architecture, Cumula provides a scalable base upon which you can grow your next web app.  As you outgrow a particular component, you can replace it without having to rewrite the entire application.

## Installation


### Step 1: Get the code

Getting the code from GitHub is easiest:

```
git clone git://github.com/Cumula/cumula-core.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest tarball from https://github.com/Cumula/cumula-core/tarball/master

Next, untar the file using

```
tar -xzf /path/to/cumula/installer.tar.bz
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

Navigate into the `cumula-core` directory and run the command

```
> ./install myAppName
```

Where `myAppName` is the name of the application (folder) you want Cumula installed to.

Additionally, you can pass a `-base-dir=/some/path` parameter if you want your app installed outside of the current directory.

### Step 3: Setup your Web Server

Follow the onscreen install instructions to set up your web server.

### Step 4: Run the GUI Setup

Finally, navigate to your web server (usually, http://localhost) and follow the setup instructions.
