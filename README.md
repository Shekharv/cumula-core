# Welcome to Cumula

## Web development for the cloud. Made easy.

Cumula is an open-source framework that creates scalable cloud-based applications.  It makes using cloud services simple, elegant and lightweight.  In other words, code less to create applications that do more. 

At its core, Cumula is a lightweight framework of pre-built components.  These components simplify the process of working with web services, meaning that it takes less code to write complicated applications.  Because of its modular architecture, Cumula provides a scalable base upon which you can grow your next web app.  As you outgrow a particular component, you can replace it without having to rewrite the entire application.
